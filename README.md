# UNETR
In a team of 3 people, we have to implement the new UNETR architecture, using MONAI and nn-UNet. We tried to apply this model to the semantic segmentation of brain tumours.   
We did this as part of Télécom Sudparis' Cassiopée project.  

This project therefore makes it possible to use this new UNETR architecture while taking advantage of the nnUNet suite, which is known for providing a medical image processing pipeline using UNET based architectures.   

The code presented here corresponds to the files in the nn-UNET module (version 1) we added for this project. These files should be placed in the corresponding folders in the module.
